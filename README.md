## My process

### Built with

-   Semantic HTML5 markup
-   CSS custom properties
-   Flexbox
-   Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

The power of using correct HTML..... Instead of using the standard form and input type="radio", I made life incredibly difficult for myself by using just the button tags. This was causing a lot of error messages when trying to writing JavaScript. This was specifically regarding the selected grey state on the rating buttons.... I was trying to create an if statement regarding if the element contained the gray out class etc etc. It was a 'right old mess'. I reached out for some advice on the Frontend Mentor slack channel and was advised to try radio buttons instead. It obviously worked and made life a lot easier.

I have learnt about string template literals and I am curious as to whether how they would be used in this instance....

### Continued development

Using proper HTML will make the job easier in the long run!
